# Il parlamento inglese

## The British System
The British system of government, over the past 800 years, power has gradually shifted from monarch to Parliament, which initially represented only nobles and wealthy men. In the 19th century, voting rights were progressively extended to all men and,  in 1928 to woman as well. 

The King or Queen is the leader of the country but does not make decisions. The government, which must answer to Parliament, has the real power. The King or Queen is also the leader of courts, the army, and the church of England but only follow the advice of ministers. The Royal family joins in ceremonies, help charities and represents the UK in other countries.

## Parliament
Parliament makes the country laws. It has three parts : The House of Commons, the House of Lords, and the Monarch.
The House of Commons is the main part. It has 650 members chosen by people over 18 every five years. It talks about politics, checks the government and agrees on the new laws.
The House of Lord has less power. It looks at laws from the House of Commons and suggest changes but cannot stop them. It has over 700 members who are not elected, some have family titles and others are chosen by the Monarch.

## The prime minister
The prime minister is the leader of the biggest party in the House of Commons. He and the government stay in power if most minister in the house of commons support theme.
The second-biggest party in the Opposition, it has a shadow prime Minister and shadow Cabinet. Their job is to check and criticize the government's decisions.
## UK and Italy Parliament
Both countries have parliaments government, and opposition, but they work differently. The UK parliament ha the house of commons, which makes laws and controls money, and the unelected house od lords, which can suggest changes but not stop laws. 
In Italy, both the Chamber of Deputies and Senate are elected and have equal power.
And another different is for Prime ministers infatti 

//  The UK Prime Minister leads the biggest party and has strong control. In Italy, the 
//  PM is chosen by the President, must get approval from both chambers and shares // power. 

The UK'Monarch is symbolic, while Italy's President has real influence.
